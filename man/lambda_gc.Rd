\title{Estimate Lambda GC from p-values}
\usage{
lambda_gc(p)
}
\arguments{
\item{p}{a numeric vector of p-values}
}
\value{
Returns a vector
}
\description{
Estimate inflation of test statistics. Lambda GC compares the median test statistic against the expected median test statistic under the null hypothesis of no association. For well-powered quantitative traits with a known polygenic inheritance, we expect inflation of lambda GC, but for traits with no expected association, we expect lambda GC to be around 1.
